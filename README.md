sigmaPad
========
A source code editor with syntax highlighting made entirely in C# and Xaml(Wpf)
Targeted at .net 4.5.1 framework


the editor uses avalonedit.TextEditor as it's editing component

all the rights reserve with the makers ICSHARPCODE and SHARPDEVELOP for the above mentioned component..

The project was made as a hobby and college project..So support really depends on how preoccupied I am with my on going course :p

its a simple,no nonsense source code editor targeted at people who want a no fuss plain and simple (yet workable) source code
playing frenzy!

=============

known bugs:
1. Tab names are err...fragile! The header set to the tabs is actually reset when a tab is added..so basically...a bust
2. currently the support for syntax highlighting is limited to a small no. of languages(would be updated ASAP)
